# SquadHire 🚀

## 🌟 The Problem We Solve
- Clients struggle to trust inexperienced freelancers  
- Students lack real, paid, industry-level exposure  
- Quality and consistency are hard to guarantee  

SquadHire solves this by combining **team-based execution**, **supervised quality control**, and **performance-driven visibility**.

## 🛡️ Supervisor Quality Gate (Our Core Differentiator)
Every project passes through a **mandatory Supervisor Quality Gate**:
- Experienced freelancers mentor student squads
- All deliverables are reviewed and vetted
- Only quality-approved work reaches the client

This **de-risks the entire process** for clients while upskilling students through guided feedback.
